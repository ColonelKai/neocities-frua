				<h2 style="text-align: center;">Submissions are OPEN for issue I!</h2>
				<p style="text-align: center; outline: 1px red dotted; color: red"><i>!!! Scroll to bottom for Submission Button !!! </i></p>
				<p>The Friedrich University is now SOLICITING for submissions for the FIRST ISSUE of the ALEXANDRIAN JOURNAL OF LAW, PHILOSOPHY AND POLITICS to be released sometime early 2026. BELOW are the REQUIREMENTS & SPECIFICATIONS for the submissions to be made.
				<h3 style="text-align: center">!!! Types of Submissions !!!</h3>
				We are primarily looking for three types of Submissions; RESEARCH PAPERs, ARTICLEs, and OPINIONs. Anyone is free to make submissions on any of the types.
				<hr>
				<h3>Research Paper Specifications</h3>
				<p>Research Papers are the most strict of the three, focusing primarily on substantiative research, such as polling, questionnaires, etc. These are primarily removed from Articles for the sake of organisation. An example may be looking at statistical corrolations between playtime and party affiliation.</p>
				<h4>Requirements:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li> Must be submitted at least 2 weeks prior publication.
					<li> Will go through rigirous scrutiny.
					<li> Must avoid unnecessary persuasiveness.
					<li> Must be credible, no pen names / anonymous submissions.
				</ul>
				<hr>

				<h3>Article Specifications</h3>
				<p>Articles are persuasive, yet analytical works mainly intended to create, participate in, or critisize philosophic/political frameworks, legal doctrines, etc. They are meant to be civil discussions on systematic and academic approaches. An example may be the formative text of your political philosophy framework on how you approach StateCraft.

				<h4>Requirements:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li> Must be submitted at least 2 weeks prior publication.
					<li> Will go through some scrutiny.
					<li> Must be constructive or have constructive critisizm.
					<li> Pen Names ALLOWED.
				</ul>
				<hr>

				<h3>Opinion Specifications</h3>
				<p>Loosest of the three, Opinions are essay-formatted submissions which are often used for things such as viewpoint declarations or calls to action. An example may be a critique of the state of the party culture from your experience.

				<h4>Requirements:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li> Must be submitted at least 3 days prior publication.
					<li> Will go through little scrutiny.
					<li> Must be submitted in good intent.
					<li> Pen Names ALLOWED.
				</ul>
				<hr>
